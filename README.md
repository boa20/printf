The printf project is a collaboration project between Philia Hammond and Baning Adjei Owusu. The focus of the project is to implement the printf() function in stdio.h as _printf().

_printf() prototype is as follows:

int _printf(const char *format, ...)

As the standard printf() is a variadic function so is _printf().
